### CAPTCHA Handling Progress:
*   Refactored `lib/captcha-solver/index.ts` to use an abstract `CaptchaSolver` class and concrete implementations for `TwoCaptchaSolver` and `AntiCaptchaSolver`.
*   Added `DeathByCaptchaSolver` integration.
*   Integrated `IntelligentCaptchaSolver` using `lib/python-bridge/index.ts` for AI-based CAPTCHA solving.
*   Added a `requestManualCaptchaSolve` method to `CaptchaManager` for fallback when automated solving fails, including logging for manual intervention.
*   Ensured `axios` is a dependency in `package.json`.

### Next Steps for CAPTCHA Handling:
1.  **Implement `requestManualCaptchaSolve` notification:** Integrate with a real-time notification system (e.g., WebSockets, email, or push notifications) to alert the user when manual CAPTCHA solving is required.
2.  **User Interface for Manual Solving:** Develop a UI component that displays the CAPTCHA image/details and allows the user to input the solution, which then gets fed back into the system.
3.  **Robust Error Handling and Retries:** Enhance error handling within each solver, including more sophisticated retry mechanisms and exponential backoff.
4.  **Dynamic Solver Selection:** Implement logic in `CaptchaManager` to dynamically select the best solver based on CAPTCHA type, cost, success rate, and current balance of the solver accounts.
5.  **Image Preprocessing for AI Solver:** Implement image preprocessing (e.g., resizing, noise reduction) before sending images to the `IntelligentCaptchaSolver` to improve accuracy.
6.  **Integration with Orchestrator:** Ensure the `Orchestrator` can effectively call the `CaptchaManager` and handle the `CaptchaSolution` or trigger manual intervention.
